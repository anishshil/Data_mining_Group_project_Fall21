In this project, we have evaluated multiple machine learning pipelines to predict rainfall on a particular day by training models on 146k weather report data from different regions in Australia. The data set consisted of 23 different kinds of features (humidity, temperature, pressure, cloud cover) where we performed individual feature analysis and achieved a test accuracy of 72%.
